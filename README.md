##Face Emotions with YOLOv11
This project is a computer vision–based emotion detection system built using the YOLOv11 model.
The model is trained to classify six basic human emotions based on Paul Ekman’s theory of emotions, which are:

😠 Angry

🤢 Disgust

😨 Fear

😊 Happy

😢 Sad

😲 Surprise

The system detects faces in real-time or from images and classifies the detected facial expression into one of these emotion categories.

Through model optimization and dataset refinement, the system achieves up to 98% emotion recognition accuracy on the validation dataset, demonstrating strong performance for real-time applications and research purposes.
